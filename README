== What is iRecovery? ==

iRecovery is a libusb-based commandline utility for Mac OS X and Linux (perhaps windows too but I'm not developing/testing under windows). It is able to talk to the iBoot/iBSS in Apple's iPhone/iPod touch via USB.

It's completely open-source, the source-code is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.
The full license text can be found in the LICENSE file.

It currently connects to 0x1281 (iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod touch, iPod touch 2G: Recovery Mode/iBSS), 0x1227 (iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod touch: WTF Mode; iPod touch 2G: DFU Mode).

== Usage ==

	-f <file>		upload file.
	-c <command>		send a single command.
	-k [payload]		send usb exploit and payload.
	-s [logfile]		starts a shell, and log output.
	-x21			Send raw CMD to 0x21.
	-x40			Send raw CMD to 0x40.
	-xA1			Send raw CMD to 0xA1.
	-r			reset usb.
	-l <file> 		sends a set of commands from a file (one per line).
	-x <file> 		Uploads a file, then auto-resets the usb connection.


Using GreySyntax or iH8Sn0w's binary and compiling you must install libusb 1.0 in order to use either of these, they added alot of things

Rewrite by GreySyntax.

At this time my Makefile only works to compile irecovery for both 1.0 and earlier libusb for MacOSX.
