TODO List

This is just a list of a couple things i've been meaning to get around to, but haven't had the chance. If you finish any of them you can go ahead and remove it from the list.
------------------------------------------------

1) Port irecovery to libusb1.0.  I've already done this in some of my other projects, and I think westbaer's brach has already been ported but our branches forked off a long time ago.

2) Add support for getenv command.  getenv sends the request variable back in a control message that can be fetched with usb_control_message(handle, 0xC0, 0, 0, 0, buffer, size, 500).

3) Fix command line parsing so you can send arguments to commands.  Currently if you try "irecovery -c bgcolor 0 0 0" only "bgcolor" will be sent and none of it's arguments.
